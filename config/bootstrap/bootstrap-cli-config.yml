  # This is a template bootstrap CLI file that will need to be completed. For a more complete example look at
  # https://github.com/cognitedata/inso-bootstrap-cli/blob/main/configs/config-deploy-example-v2.yml

    features:
    # v2 adding as features, available as cli paramaters only atm (v1)
    # allowed values are parsed case-insensitive: [true|yes|YES|..] or [false|no|NO|..]
    # not as strings in quotes "yes" or 'yes'

    # The default and recommended value is: false
        with-datamodel-capability: false

    # default and recommended is: true
        with-raw-capability: true

    # new in v2 to configure prior (v1) hard-coded naming elements
    # Most of the naming-configurations don't have a functional effect, but affect
    # naming of Groups, Datasets and RAWDBs only.
    # All given feature values are reflecting the default values,
    # to support a smooth v1 migration.
    #
    # Recommended values for a new v2-project are given as comments!


    # default is: allprojects
    #   recommended is shorter: 'all'

    # default and recommended is: cdf
    #   supports empty-string ''

    # default is: dataset
    #  recommended is shorter 'ds' or minimal ''
    #   supports empty-string ''

    # default is: rawdb
    #  recommended is shorter 'db' or minimal ''
        rawdb-suffix: db

    # Suffix added to all space names. The recommended value is spc. Defaults to space
        space-suffix: spc

    # default is" ['state']
    #   meant for separating the statestores from extractors from ingested data
    #   recommended: keep it or []
    #   more rawdbs can be configured at a later stage
    #   supports empty list [] for no additional variants
        rawdb-additional-variants:
      # provide more than one rawdb per ns-nodes
      # atm (v1) hardcoded is one additional rawdb
